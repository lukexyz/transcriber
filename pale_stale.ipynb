      "\t  Hello and welcome to Madden Jerry's podcast of their radio show. These are the only bits that we thought were probably worth listening to again. There are some other bits that were okay, but these are probably the best bits that we've got. Madden Jerry, it is of course Cyber Bullying Monday. You can text us your best bully now on 3483 or you can tweet it to Krowink. You can also bully us directly to our earholes on 0800 Hode Aquinas. Here's the carryover section of Bill English's The Double Dipper from Dupton, then Matt Heath is The Double Du Spag of Deniedon and Jeremy is the punishing power bottom of Pondombe. Hepsters have ruined fashion and beets, baby members have destroyed the property market. Now you two meet sex, have killed breakfast radio. I always skip this one. Next one. Might as well skip this one. I don't need it. Starlight Macintosh didn't exist until butch our scrapes and I can de-met. I'm gonna read, I actually thought it was something else for the second. Starlight Macintosh didn't exist until butch our scrapes and I can de-met. It's bound like one night. No. It's it's barn. I'm sorry. I've been a grew up in a barn and I've been sitting to Matt's barn. I've been sitting there a lot about me. They know the neighbour and my childhood friend before I was four and that I lived in a barn. Out the back of my parents' house. I think it's a typo. I think it's meant to be barn. Well, I've more butcher's scrapes. Snook into your world. You need to stay for that button. You're gonna get stuck for that. Like the morbidly obese Egyptian woman, you two bag of debt. No. We can get stuck for this. Remember we're a seed we're exempt. We're reading out of people stuff. Yeah, it's not really a fault as a. No. Okay. Like the morbidly obese Egyptian woman, you two bag of downstairs operations need to be cleaned out with a good dose of salmonella. Devin from Christchurch called up with us. I would rather have starlight Macintosh. These feed me a gem-packie come back at us. Why are you listening to Matt Hase? 2,000. Or when do a song about doing number one? And put up with the back of a link, I'm going to do two wagons. Put your listen on. Sorry. Most mornings. So from all of us here at 18 media lunch. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Back at the league. Back at the league. You waked this. That's very good. That's very good. All right. Let's go to the challenges. Okay. Remember if an earthquake is long or strong, get gone. Same applies for the Hodaki brick first. If you hear two coups were ending punishing Naptides, turn the radio dial to Rima. Hearing your show first thing in the morning is not so polite. Remind or I forgot to drown myself in the shower this morning. From Sam and Wellington. Exam. Do you know who else heard imaginary friends as a kid? They were real people. Do you remember just imagine they were friends? That's good. Let's go to the phones. Man Jerry should be replaced by Macintosh. In a book chocolate, I imagine the show would finally be decent. That's good point. I'm Jim D. Late at playboy found a huge hyphneur and stinky old man responds to Internet dear thromers. Soon a rest made at Christmas in the park despite no one being there. But now Joseph Parker brushes off for criticism. Joseph Parker has brushed off a backlash against his majority decision victory over Andy Rui's junior. To become a world heavyweight champion on set the night. New Zealand professional boxing association president Lance Rival Sid mexico in the Reel's junior was robbed and the result made him embarrassed to be in New Zealander. Parker 24 was given the decision after 12 rounds with one judge scoring at 1 14 1 14 and the other two, 115 to 1 13. Rival by contrast scored at 1 18 to 1 11. That was in favour of Reel's junior. It's more than 18 to 1 11. So what's going on here? I mean what? What is that with boxing? Someone can get it one 18 to 1 11. Imagine if you finished a game of rugby and you had three score as one of them was so wildly different from the other ones. But you know what happens every single time. I mean that that's always by one or two. You really tell me that after all those punches. Yeah, you really tell me that. It's a vibe thing. It's like gymnastics. It's a vibe thing. And the vibe can be influenced by the fact you've got 10,000 Joseph Parker fans in the stadium potentially. Oh and the other big thing is who's paying the belt? Yeah. So who's paying you? Because obviously Duke of Pay the pay the judges. So at that point they think, do I want to do another one of these events or do I not want to do another one of these? I mean they're guy that scored at 1 14 to 1 14. I'd like to know how he goes next time. What I don't understand in looking is that we're just talking out of our assets here. We don't know there's no one. No allegations. I mean whatever. We're just saying that you pay for 60 bucks to watch a fight and that the end of it you go. I don't really know what's going on. But that's your boxing across the board. But what I don't understand if boxing right. Why don't you have you high off. So let's say it's 12 rounds. So you hire four people or watching on Slomo. And the first person is watching the first round and scoring it going through frame by frame. And then they go through to the fourth round. And so they've got plenty of time to score it. And at the end you might just have to have about another five six minutes where they go through and score it. There's two people there. There's a guy operating the machine and someone that's a boxing expert and they just go through and they go, you're that punch, that counts, that's in a gris of punch, that's, you know, they go through and actually score it like an actual competition. Well that would make it proper though. That's then you'd get a result of the proper result. That's not what you're after here. You've pointed out before it's a promotion. It's about making money. Well this thing is called a promotion. Yeah. It's about making money. It's not about the actual sport itself. I want to I'd love to get a camera and some microphones and on the actual judges and just after the bounce finished. Yeah. What happens after you have this all that time? What happens after the bounce finished and then before they announce a result like it must be so much back. It must be like when billing this was trying to get the numbers to become the national party leader. Like the stuff that's going on behind the scenes at that point. Well well, yeah. Fascinating. Exactly. I find it really interesting. I think that's why people do love boxing because yes sure you know it's completely dodgy. But at the same time, that's just kind of how it is. That's just boxing. But it's still interesting. And I'll be interesting to go back to round three and see the notes of a judge scoring it and then go through slow motion and say how did you score this? Exactly. And do it again. Yeah. Do it again. It's off. Back to the back talk. So we've got five times the fact that here's the topic this morning. Egyptian a man I'm Ed L. Artie is believed with the world's heaviest woman. She's about to leave her home for the first time in two decades. Floated in there for weight reduction surgery. So this morning, Matt and the fake factor I'd like one fat fact, one lady fact, one Egyptian fact. Pleasure capable of that. Absolutely. Five hundred kj's. That's he V.A. Ed. Frick and he. That is very, very heavy. If you've never got up there, I mean, what are you 100 and currently 96? Have you ever got so fat? You've had to be creamed out of a house and put a blind at it. And do you ever quag at that far? No. No, how about you? No, that got close, but never actually had to have the creamed out. Yeah. When they've got to open up your roof. Bring your creamed out. When you start looking at life and go, maybe I need to make some changes. Yeah. Maybe I need to go on the blood sugar diet. Maybe look up Mr. Acons. Yeah. Well, I think as well for a guy. There's generally telltale signs and it's got to do with looking down. Yeah, it's not. And if you can't see what you're looking down at, at their point, you know, you've got some issues. Well, I don't think this one one would be able to see what she's looking down at. Watch it. No, I don't think she's been seeing what she was looking down at since the 80s. Hmm. All right. I can't. Hey, guy. I'm ready to go. Right. You're capable of one fat fact, one ladyfactor, one Egyptian fact. I'm absolutely capable of really to go. Let's do it. All right. What is your first fat fat? Don't you tell me you're full to eat it. In weight loss, 84% of the fat that is lost turns into carbon dioxide and leaves the body through the lungs. I'm fine. What a fact. That has the fact back down. You get so it's a good, I guess it does. Yeah. Because you burn it. Yeah. Hey. Well, it gets not stored as fat. I don't know. Now, because it's, okay. So it's, it's fat is stored energy, right? Yeah. And then when you burn that energy, when your body burns it, it actually burns it. Right. And then it comes out, yeah. And then your lungs is down. I'm dying. So, it comes out, you're long. I want a fat. Great fat. Great fat. It's an exact fat. It's an exact fat. I'll do the abdomen and your face will not. In 2000. Beautiful. And 2011, a Swedish woman found her Whitting ring on a carrot growing in her backyard. 16 years after Miss Placing it. Fak, do he's fat. Ten of a lot of vibe with that one. I'm invoking my right to a lifeline. I always wondered how I can keep one Call of Decide with it that fat was good or bad. Yes, so the fact being in 2011, a Swedish woman found her Whitting ring on a carrot growing in her backyard. 16 years after Miss Placing it. Good morning, Brad. How about you, Thomas? Good a bad fact. Brad? I think that was more of a gardening sex. Yeah. And a green thing. Thank you. That's fat. I had a very bad vibe to it as well, Brad. I thought it just wasn't. Yeah. It was slightly sexist. Yeah, it doesn't fit, right. You got to be very careful with these. So you don't want any sexist or racist facts. And there, thanks, Brad. I appreciate you back in the up there. One good, one bad fact, Matt. Careful with the vibe as well. What's your third and final Egyptian fact? Can I get an Egyptian? Oh, it is. An Egyptian, um, sorry. Ancient Egyptian Whitman who dug the ferros terms weren't slaves. Not only did they get paid in a house. They got paid sick leave and were given beers at the end of the working day. According to 3000 year old, where it cords. FACT YOU HEAT THAT'S FACT! Again, the vibe just didn't like the vibe of that one. Innocence just started doing my admin forming. I just got a bad vibe from the rest of those facts. For some reason, I'm not sure why. It's not the vibe factor, you're it. It's the fact factor. Yeah, but it just got a bad vibe. I mean, I'm not doubting that that's a fact. Just didn't feel very good to me, so you're not suffocated to me. This one's really got it. So you started off really well. I was feeling really good about that one. And you just went downhill. Matt Heath and Jeremy Wells, the whole deck he breakfast. You might remember Spiderman Scotty from the Sprat-Round Scotty, uh, Sprat-Round. Rasport. What's up? What's up? Well, he's got the un-scotty. I've known Scott. Oh, what's that? I've known Scott. I've been into this. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sprat-Round Scotty. Yeah, of course I know Sprat-Round Scotty. I think I've known Sprat-Round Scotty for longer than you. No. Yeah, no. No, I know him from when he was on tour with the general throwing, sitting him up in the older. Sure. It's when I first met you. You remember you took the general out of the road, it was you still roast the Spiderman and you've been in the Spiderman. I like to play my one now. And I went for you ever and you. The did bungee jumping every day. I pretty much head to him and flake this giant and flatable, spaceman slash look after the general. How was that? How was the look and preface? Get him up. Not easy looking after the fucker. Because I was quite new back from overseas at that time and met it as is like, what does it like with the general on the road? It's really good now and it's like, come on mate. I was filming that. A giant and flatable general. A giant of flatable spaceman. It shows. I bet you've moved on from spraying it around the mountains and and flating the general to a period on television and a dating show tonight at that thing. Yeah, I've really, really on low little low level bottom feed of these. Guys, things have been going so well since the spread around snow report ramped up. So I thought why not go on a dating show to really boost this profile. Look, I thought you had a lot. I mean, they don't call you Sprite Round Squaddy for nothing. I mean, you sprayed it around the Slopes. You sprayed it around our pro situations. Was that a not enough spray for you, Scott? No, you're going to be in a spray jury. It's just I, you know, I just thought that maybe this is an opportunity to my love to find to find love. I found that special girl. I mean, four people that haven't seen Sprite Round Squaddy is a very good looking man. It's a very, very good looking man, very handsome. Great. Well grown. Looks great. Smells great. Always smells great. Pears on has tender profile holding a dog. I mean, that's the kind of man he is. Yep. You know, for two of me. It's not a dog. So Scott, it's got a year on first dates. It's a year on, in Z tonight, eight thirty on TV. To. Um, what can you tell us about the process of the of the first day? Because I've been watching first dates. It's a really good show. Yeah. It's set at at at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at the, at the sky tower. Yeah. And now one of the restaurants and sky city. Yeah. It was a bit of a newsy process. I wasn't really looking to go on anything like this and a free and kind of put me up for it. I think I've been complaining about my woman situation for some time now. Really got sick and we're talking about not really going on any dates when you think like that and filled out the application and got on the show and, uh, yeah. It was, I mean, if you, if you have, if you have seen this show, you see that it is quite awkward sometimes. Um, so that's the basic premise. Yeah, right. Wow. Two people going on a date. Yeah. And they arrive and they've never obviously blind date. They've never met each other. But the interesting thing about the show is there's lot to's about five people, Yeah. So five people going on at the same time and it cuts between all the get up dates that are happening. But some are awkward, some are not awkward. But it's a clever show because obviously they filmed it all the dates are not occurring on one night. And you get the vibe that you're going around a restaurant listening and on conversations that are happening. Any LG BT community. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. There's always an LG BT after any show. You'd have to have an LG BT date near. Yeah. And that's now from the interesting ones because they get smashed. Yeah. They get smashed. We'll have a date with you on. You're on the TV. I was on it from the TV from the LG BT and the TV. Yeah, I was the TV easily. You were in a standard heterosexual situation, Scotty. Very much standard heterosexual situation, Jerry. And what can you bring good chat? Um, yeah. Did she bring good chat? Yes, she did actually. Because I mean, only things that you don't really know what you're going to get do here. And did you get on the stage? Yeah. She enjoyed it. And so I started off on the beers. Yeah. And she's like, now let's move to the reds. So we, you know, move to the reds and then did you move back to your house? Oh, is that? By guess you can't know it. There you can. So the can. I can't. What about those Spray-Round Scotty? What about if what about, uh, could you tell me? Because you're not the end. It's always like who's going to pay the bill. Yeah. I, I'm not convinced that you have to pay that bill. Because why the hell would you go on a dating show that you had to pay the bill? That doesn't seem right. Well, even think I must re-go straight for it. But I don't get paid for it. What? But I don't expect to get paid for it either. What? And then you hit to pay the bill. What did you go Dutch on it? No, no, no. Why would you mug yourself off on this hotel version of not pay for it? A meal. You can't like halves. You can't doubt it. You cannot. You cannot go halves. You gotta go halves on it. You'd have to go halves. If your saying success not to......be more expensive. Man. As both success and more expensive. That's why that's by the Dutcher such an innovative society with the Dutch writers and the, um, going Dutch. That's why you ended up with Butch Haskere. That reason right there. Right there. So you paid Scotty. I certainly did, Jerry. I, um, see, I got his an old-world kind of sort of carry grant kind of handsome kind of operators. So, um, so, um,...teably two tonight Scotty, eight 30. Yeah. First. Have you seen it? No, I haven't. I've seen it all these years. You've been worried. Nah. You didn't see it. I guess, like, I guess you go on these, on these sorts of things expecting that you might get a bit of a flag. I know my friends have organized a viewing party. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. See you think? Right. And I'm probably going to hear about it for the next six months. But I'm prepared for that. Okay. Okay. I can't wait to say it. First dates. In Z830 TV 2..................................... Later, a rest made at Christmas in the park. Because there wasn't very many people there, so the cops could see the kids drinking. Soon, Joseph Parker. Brush is off, fight, Chris is of so-so-so-so-so. Can I say that again? Soon, Joseph Parker. Brush is off, fight, Chris is a man, Kevin Barry brushes his hair completely from the back to the front. But now, Hugh Hifner responds to Internet dearth rumors. Hugh Hifner has insisted he is not dead. Oh, the 90-year-old is called, that's a huge promise. Quickly, spread over the weekend that he had died. He hasn't been seen in public since May. And last month, his ex-girlfriend, Kendra Wilkinson, that basket. I've heard that the playboy mentioned has become dangerously depressing in smells like Old Man Week. Now, smells like Old Man Week. Yes, smells like Old Man Week. It is old. Yeah. The playboy mentioned now. And he's getting on about it, 90. Have you seen photos of him? Yes, and lately? He's looking okay for 90, like 90's pretty old. Has he had any work done? I actually don't reckon he's had a lot of work done. No, and I think that's kind of helped him. If he has had work done, it's been very subtle. It's sort of a weird thing, isn't it? Because he was the definition of who everyone arguably wanted to be, living the dream of a man. But now it just seems a little bit walking around with your sort of night gown on. Well, that's the great thing, is he's been wearing that ton. He's been wearing the robe. The robe? What does that mean? Sleeping gown? It's a kimono. He's been wearing that kimono for so long now that now that he's dangerously ill and old. He's wearing the kimono, and it's seamless. I mean, that's genius. Genius piece of work from home. He started dressing as an old, invalid man like Wayback in his late 20s. And he's just kept going, and now it's finally growing into being that your own stay in old man. It loves watching old movies now. So just hangs out, he's 90, he watches some old movies. Not a lot of action going on anymore, because he's supposed to build his action, of course, back when he was in his mid 80s. Yeah. The Jumimagirls of the Playboy Mansion, the Realty Series. What the interesting thing about that was you never ever saw him dancing for a long period of time in the full-length shot? No. Did you have a notice that? You could just see the top of the velvet rug. And then him sort of going, this weird kind of wobble to you. Yeah, yeah. Because if you ever saw his legs, it was a humiliating dance to no guy. And a lot of his eaks, lovers, because he goes through them and they all look exactly the same. Playboy Bunning style, Bon Gills. Have come out and see, he was horrible in the sack. Not terrible, like just an absolute massive disappointment. And running a minute operation and just there's nothing going on. Is there a right? I don't know, he's running a minute operation. Yeah. Strange. A lot of better tell-all tail books through that and then to try and sell it and see what's your cup of... Oh, that's probably what's happening here. Hey, Jerry Up next though. I'd like to go through the list of the top five, six years not dead people. This is the middle of the Matt and Jerry podcast, which means... Which means it's not actually, it's not the middle. Well, close enough to the middle. Yeah, but it's not the actual, okay. You are a certain way through the Matt and Jerry podcast. There's still some great stuff to come, so listen to the end and then the rest of it's not very good either. Okay. All right, so... I'm so nice to time, it's a little bit here. All right. Okay. I'll just shut up, and chill. She's just... Right. So, in light of Playboy Fanna Hugh, you're not announcing your survey, isn't it, did? Yeah. You've handed me a list of your top five, not dead people. Yeah. You're seeing it. Yeah, I am ready, I've got it right here. All right. Here we go. Number five. Keith Richards. Yeah, he's not actually that old, but he looks at due to all the smack booze and crack he head over the ears. I mean, his face is as a mess. He looks like he's about 95, but no Keith Richards, a good touch with the wrong stones. He's still alive. And there's been a lot of tea total is out there that have died before 72 that are just... They're just really, really pissed off at Keith Richards right now. Amazingly, he's looked like he's about 86 for about 30 years. He went in about 1984. He suddenly jumped up about 30 years in age. Yep. And he's just sort of grown on from there. It looks terrible. Okay. Here on this list. Number four. So David Atembro. Yeah, he's 90. The botanist in an extra dock voice over legend, Bo Liga does hell him. And if you look at the way, if they ever do a wide shot now on a hum, he has legs. He looks like he's just got off a horse. He hobbles along like an old puff and... But he's got lots of here. He's got lots of here. It's sticking up. But he's definitely not dead because I've bought tickets too. Has performance in next year. That doesn't mean that he's not dead. Really? No. Well, they're not going to just get it. Not going to like, trooper. Did you buy them off her? No. That doesn't mean it's a fraud. Yeah, maybe. You never know. Number three. That's his Angela Lensbury. Yeah. What? He's there. You remember that TV show? Murdered she wrote from the 80s. Yeah, she was the rust on the roof damp down below. Hmm. Well, remember that there was the dank she was the dangerously old lady. And starred in Murder She wrote in the Medadi. And she's not dead. In fact, she's still acting. Really? You would have given every dollar in your banking out to say the Angela Lensbury would be dead. But she's not. She's 92. Mass of Miss Marple's rip off, but still going. Okay. Yeah. Number two here. Number two. Again, off. Yeah, again, off. He's not dead. He was fighting the bell rock on the bridge of Moria. Just after going. You was down on bass. And then, of course, the tail and the duck and drag demand. And he said, run your foods. And then, all the little people cried. And cried. And cried. The hobbits were crying in slow motion with no sound. But apparently, if you see the second movie, which I haven't apparently, he didn't die. Oh, I'm massive, spoiler alert. She's basically 2,000 and 19 years old. That's a massive spoiler. Almost people that haven't seen water the rings are just waiting to watch at some point. Well, I found a bit ripped off to find out because I got quite upset that it was dead. And apparently, he just changes his cloak. Hey, don't. And he comes back and he fresh cloak and then it's easel. Good to go. Oh, you're just, you're just rolling up for thousands of people. I can't just waiting and hanging out. All right. Number one. The number one. Yeah. Most important not dead person. I guess is that where you call this? John K. Yeah. He's 55. He's not dead. He's just retired. And Bill English is the new P.M. But John K. Not dead. Scotty James Stevenson on sport. Oh, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Jail by plate. Ripper sport. And come back. I can't wait. America's Cup will stay in America. And sports. No, no, no, no, no. Jail by plate. Jail by plate. Jail by plate. Jail by plate. Good morning. Scotty James Stevenson. Let's get straight into the controversy around the park. A fight. Scotty James Stevenson. This needs to be addressed. Massive controversy. The thing everyone's talking about. And it's Kevin Barris here. What is happening here? Kevin Barris. Kevin Barris. Yeah. Look, it's the honest. It's just an extraordinary, solid expression of Kevin Barris personality. They entire lead. Brust forward from the ace of the neck. And the whole way. It has just been perfectly brushed. All my sister say, I know everyone on the planet does it the other way. But I'm an individual. The other thing. Scotts, come on to the Scottish Daily Sims. The must be asked is, what product is Kevin Barris? Kevin Barris running in the here. Because it always seems to be moist. And is that product? Has that product dropped its way down onto his face? Because that's the other thing. Is this face? It tends to be dangerously moist as well. And I've got one final question for you. Scotts, come on to the Scottish Daily Sims on that same issue. Is that product that's coming from his head? Drupping down his face? Is that the reason why he's dangerously read? Because that's reacting with the sun's rays. And giving him a massive burn on his face. I would be surprised if there's a little bottling plant in Vegas. And it's just bottling Joseph Parker sweat. And that has been just sprayed liberally into the here, which then drips down the face. And we all know, Jerry, at the last point, that usually when you're sweating your head, the heaps, given Barris reacting to the Joseph Parker sweat here product. And this is why we are seeing this discharge that we've become accustomed to. Some overseas box and commentators have suggested that the whole Kevin Barry look is just a massive distraction. Because Andy Ruehr's junior, he won the first four, three to four rounds quite easily. But then he was sort of losing his position a little bit. And Joseph Parker got back into the fight a little bit. And it kind of looked like Ruehr was looking over at Joseph Parker's corner. And he was either, it was either Martin Snedon's French or Kevin Barry's here, combed right from the very base of his neck forward. That was distracting Andy Ruehr. I think there was also a hint that Craig Stenaway was giving him a spin cry at the time. And you know, one once that, I look, I wouldn't have been surprised if Ruehr was distracted by Kevin Barry's here. And this is something that other heavy weights in this division are going to have to come up against this well. And it's nice. It's cool. Cool. Cool. You like about the jab about ring position. But one glint of Kevin Barry's here with the Joe Parker's sweat solution. And I'll tell you what, you could be a night over, could be your hopes and dreams crushed. Well, that's also, I believe he's been running a sunbed the way he has. And so he's dangerously read. And that way it's essentially like a stop light that's just flashing in the corner. And so when you're boxing, if you've got a read flashing light with a bizarre haircut, you only need that tiny little bit of distraction, you're not thinking about boxing, mixing you know you've lost the belt. Well, look at Don King. I mean, for years, Don King was on writing that straight up in the air shock of here. It's a distraction. It's a mess of distraction. I mean, look at the bird's doing. Look at what bird's doing. He had the, John King had the good as an even to be ringside. He wouldn't be in the corner. He was no corner man, Don King. He was a promoter. So, you know, there's an arguably no one really had to be distracted by Don King's here during the fight. And like all of those now, coming up against Don supermarket, they have to be distracted by it. But you'd see that he's walking past the foot, let we just go past it. Just see like a troll. Like a troll. Like a 19's troll doll. Yeah, but, but I would say this, Sky Sports commentator, Scotty Jazz Stevenson, and Matt as well. I'm directing this to you as well. The amount of moisture that's coming out of the hair out of the face of Kevin Barry. If he's allowed in the ring at any time, he can just, he can just slip, slip, he can drop his neck down, drop his chin, and he can let some of that moisture drip down onto the canvas. And that can easily provide, and if Joseph pack a mousse away from it, but directs Andy Ruiz into that, he can easily slip. So, you were saying that part of the Joe Parker strategy from here on is put the other guy on the Wexpot. And then it's almost like having a banana skin underneath your foot. Well, people would have noticed the state of the riff in that fight. He was soaking wet all over. This shirt was completely wet, and he was wearing a pair of gloves, and there was two theories in there. Either, he thought they looked cool on the Michael Jackson sort of star, or they were sort of protective gloves like a policeman would wear, picking up a drunk person off the road. But he was so wet, he was so wet, and people thought that was coming off the box, but it was actually just a residual sweat flying off Kevin Barry's face. Thanks a lot, Sky Sports commentator Scotty Jazz Stevenson. It heathed Jeremy Wells, the Haudackie breakfast. I tell you what, Jeremy, I'm very excited about Rogue One that's coming out this week, the new Star Wars movie being a massive star was fanship for the Phantom Menace, take of the clones, and revenge of the Seth, those the only Star Wars movies that I don't like. Hey, yum, but the best TV series of the of the year is ended now. This one, yeah. Westworld. And the thing about Westworld is it was coming out every week, rather than the normal binge watching situation. So now people that haven't watched it should binge watch it. If you watch it. No, I haven't watched it. I just got onto the crown over the weekend, got onto the crown, I'm six deep in the crown. Well, once you finish with the crown, get onto Westworld. I got black mirror, I got black mirror lined up. Oh, black mirror's bloody good as well, but once you finish with the crown and black mirror, get onto Westworld. I've got house of cards lined up after black mirror and the crown, which has a card, the last season, I'm going to rewatch that and then also I've got this a prano as as well. I think it's six, even watch this. I have, I've watched it for six rounds. Go all through the spannas before you watch Westworld. What about? If you say that you can watch the wild before you get to Westworld, then I've got to watch the wild actually because I sort of dipped out in the last, I've kept falling asleep in the last season. I tell you what, if you want to show that has more twists and turns than a plate of spaghetti ballignazer than you want to watch with. We've got more meat. It's cut. It's very meaty. More meat than a ballignazer. It's cut more meat and six than a spaghetti ballignazer. More cheese than a spaghetti ballignazer. There's not much cheese in it. Okay, it's pretty cheese free, actually. Well, that's probably quite good. Well, they do see. They see. These violent delights have violent ends. Saying that, that's probably the closest to a cheese. As you does have a cheese, because some of the storylines for the robots will fully cheesy within the part. Well, I think you need a little bit of poems and cheese on the top, don't you? Just a fraction. She's a made up ballignazer last night for my kids, and I put about half a block of 1KG tasty on top of the ballignazer to cover up some crimes like committed with the months halfway through. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? You can't just do one thing. You get bored. So you have, as the same as the radio show, you pick up something, you're on something else, you're having a look on, you completely doing something else. It's like, you can't just focus on one thing. Hey, Joe, we should give away some black caps, dockets here, thanks to see what's right before the black. You can't focus in on listening to me talk to you. You judge us and make the decisions. And now it's time for the whole Akibre first weekly cyber bully award ceremony. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Congeniality. This bill English is the double-duper from Dippton. Then Matt Heath is the double-dush bag of deniedonend Jeremy is the punishing power bottom of Ponson B. Um, please welcome our running rap. I would rather his starlight make a touch. He's called me a jump-packie come burger. Why is listening to net haste? Or, when do a song about doing number one?

      "\t  Hello and welcome to Matt and Gerry's podcast of their radio show. These are the only bits that we thought were probably worth listening to again. There were some other bits that were okay, but these are probably the best bits that we've got. Matt and Gerry, it is of course Cyber Bully Monday. You can text us your best bully now on 3483 or you can tweet it to Crywing. You can also bully us directly to our ear holes on 0800Hodaki as well. Here's the carryover section, if Bill English is the double dipper from Dipton then Matt Heath is the double douchebag of Dunedin and Jeremy is the punishing power bottom of Ponsonby. Hipsters have ruined fashion and beards, bagbeam members have destroyed the property market. Now you two meat sacks have killed Breakfast Radio. I will skip this next one. Might as well skip this next one. I'll read it. Starlight Macintosh didn't exist until Butch Arsegrab snuck into Matt's... I'm going to read... I actually thought it was something else for a second. Starlight Macintosh didn't exist until Butch Arsegrab snuck into Matt's bum late one night. No, it's barn. I grew up in a barn on a farm. I suppose it knows a lot about me. They know the name of my childhood friend before I was four and that I lived in a barn out the back of my parents' farm. I think it's a typo. I think it's meant to be bum. What Butch Arsegrab snuck into your bum. You need stung for that buddy. You're going to get stung for that. Like the morbidly obese Egyptian woman, you too bag of de... No. We can't get stung for these, remember? We've said we're exempt. We're reading out other people's stuff. Yeah, it's not really in a fold, is it? No. Okay. Like the morbidly obese Egyptian woman, you too bag of downstairs operations need to be cleaned out with a good dose of salmonella. Devin from Christchurch called up with this. I would rather have Starlight Macintosh who feed me a Jim Hickey Cumberger whilst listening to Matt Heath's 2004 Wounder of a Song about doing number one and put up with the back of a length punishment you too wagons put your listeners through most mornings. So from all of us here at Eating Media Lunch. The high level operations from Devin. Back of the length punishment. You wagons. That's very good. That's very good. All right, let's go to the challenges. Okay. When the earthquake is long or strong, get gone, same applies for the Hauraki Breakfast. If you hear two coos warning punishing muptards, turn the radio dial to Rima. Hearing your show first thing in the morning is not so polite reminder. I forgot to drown myself in the shower this morning from Sam and Wellington. Thanks, Sam. Jeremy Wells had imaginary friends as a kid. They were real people. Jeremy just imagined they were his friends. That's good. Let's go to the phones. I think Jerry should be replaced by Starlight Macintosh and Butch Asgrap. I imagine the show would finally be decent. That's a good point. The agenda. Later Playboy founder Hugh Hefner and stinky old man responds to internet death rumours. Soon, arrests made at Christmas in the park despite no one being there. But now Joseph Parker brushes off fight criticism. Joseph Parker has brushed off a backlash against his majority decision victory over Andy Ruiz Jr. to become world heavyweight champion on Saturday night. New Zealand Professional Boxing Association President Lance Revel said Mexican Ruiz Jr. was robbed and the result made him embarrassed to be a New Zealander. Parker 24 was given the decision after 12 rounds with one judge scoring at 114-114 and the other two 115-113. Revel by contrast scored at 118-111. That was in favour of Ruiz Jr. 118-111. So what's going on here? What is that with boxing? Someone can get it 118-111. Mention if you finished a game of rugby and you had three scorers and one of them was so wildly different from the other ones. But you know what happens every single time. That's always by one or two. Are you really telling me that… After all those punches? Yeah, are you really telling me that? It's a vibe thing. It's like gymnastics. It's a vibe thing. And the vibe can be influenced by the fact you've got 10,000 Joseph Parker fans in the stadium potentially. Oh and the other big thing is who's paying the bill? So who's paying you? Because obviously, Duko pay the judges. So at that point they think do I want to do another one of these events or do I not want to do another one of these events? I mean that guy that scored at 114-114, I'd like to know how he goes next time. What I don't understand and look, we're just talking out of our asses here. We don't know. There's no allegations. I mean whatever. We're just saying that you pay for 60 bucks to watch a fight and at the end of it you go, I don't really know what's going on. But that's the history of boxing across the board. But what I don't understand, if boxing, right, why don't you hire, so let's say it's 12 rounds, so you hire four people all watching on slow-mo and the first person is watching the first round and scoring it going through frame by frame and then they go through to the fourth round. And so they've got plenty of time to score it and at the end you might just have to have about another five, six minutes while they go through and score it. There's two people there, there's a guy operating the machine and someone that's a boxing expert and they just go through and they go, yes, that's a punch, that counts, that's an aggressive punch. They go through and actually score it like an actual competition. Well that would make it proper though. Then you'd get a result, the proper result. That's not what you're after here. As you've pointed out before, it's a promotion. It's about making money. Well that's the thing, it's called a promotion. It's about making money. It's not about the actual sport itself. I'd love to get a camera and some microphones in on the actual judges and just after the bouts finished, right? What happens after, you know how there's all that time? What happens after the bouts finished and then before they announce the result like there must be so much back, it must be like when Bill English was trying to get the numbers to become the National Party leader. The stuff that's going on behind the scenes at that point. Fascinating. Exactly. I find it really interesting. It's massively interesting. I find it really interesting. I think that's why people do love boxing. Because yeah sure you know it's completely dodgy but at the same time that's just kind of how it is. That's just boxing but it's still interesting. And it'll be interesting to go back to round three and see the notes of a judge scoring it and then go through slow motion and say how did you score this? Exactly. And do it again, you know? Yeah. Do it again. It's the Fact Fact Talk. Here's the topic this morning. Egyptian Aman Ahmed Abdel-Ati is believed to be the world's heaviest woman. She's about to leave her home for the first time in two decades to fly to India for weight reduction surgery. So this morning Matt and the Fact Factor, I'd like one fat fact, one lady fact and one Egyptian fact. Please are you capable of that? Absolutely. 500kgs, that's heavy eh? That's freaking heavy. That's very, very heavy. Have you ever got up that high? I mean what are you, 100 and? Currently 96. Have you ever got so fat you've had to be craned out of a house and put on a plane to India to get? Never quite that far, no. No. No, how about you? Neither, got close but never actually had to have the crane out. Yeah. When they've got to open up your roof and bring a crane in. That's when you start looking at life and going maybe I need to make some changes? Yeah. Maybe I need to go on the blood sugar diet? Maybe look up Mr Atkins? Yeah. Yeah. Well I think as well for a guy. There's generally telltale signs and it's got to do with looking down. Yeah. Doesn't it? And if you can't see what you're looking down at, at that point you know you've got some issues. Well I don't think this woman would be able to see what she's looking down at, would she? No, I don't think she's been seeing what she was looking down at since the 80s. Alright okay. I'm ready to go. Alright, are you capable? Are you capable of one fat fact, one lady fact and one Egyptian fact? I'm absolutely capable and ready to go. Let's do it. What is your first fat fact? In weight loss, 84% of the fat that is lost turns into carbon dioxide and leaves the body through the lungs. What a fact. That has the fact factor. I guess that's a good, I guess it does. Yeah. Because you burn it. Yeah. Hey. Well it gets not stored as fat. I don't know actually why I have it. No, because it's, okay, so it's fat is stored energy right? Yeah. And then when you burn that energy, when your body burns it, it actually burns it. Right. And then it comes out your? Comes out your lungs as carbon dioxide. Comes out your lungs. Oh what a fact. Great fact man. Great fact. What's your next fact? I'll do the ad-money thanks very much. In 2011 a Swedish woman was killed by a car accident. In 2011 a Swedish woman found her wedding ring on a carrot growing in her backyard 16 years after misplacing it. Fact you Heath. That's fact. I didn't like the vibe of that one. I'm invoking my right to a lifeline. 0800 Hauraki, one caller decides whether that fact was good or bad. Yes, so the fact being in 2011 a Swedish woman found her wedding ring on a carrot growing in her backyard 16 years after misplacing it. Good morning Brad. How are you fellas? Got a bad fact Brad. I think that was more of a gardening fact though. I agree. Fact you Heath. That's fact. I had a bad vibe to it as well Brad. I thought it just wasn't. It was slightly sexist. Yeah it didn't sit right. You've got to be very careful with these. You don't want any sexist or racist facts in there. Thanks Brad. I appreciate you backing me up there. One good one, bad fact. Matt, careful with the vibe as well. What's your third and final Egyptian fact? An Egyptian, sorry, ancient Egyptian workmen who dug the Pharaoh's tombs weren't slaves. Not only did they get paid and housed, they got paid sick leave and were given beers at the end of the working day according to 3000 year old records. Fact you Heath. That's fact. Again the vibe, just didn't like the vibe of that one. Ever since you started doing my admin for me I've just got a bad vibe from the rest of those facts for some reason. I'm not sure why. It's not the vibe factor Jerry, it's the fact factor. Yeah but I've just got a bad vibe. I mean I'm not doubting that that's a fact. I'm just, it just didn't feel very good to me so you haven't got the fact factor to do it. This one's really good HC. It started off really well. I was feeling really good about that. And it just went downhill. Matt Heath and Jeremy Wells, the Hauraki Breakfast. You might remember Spray It Around Scotty from the Spray It Around Scotty, Spray It Around report. Well I do. Of course I do. Well there he is right there. I've known Scotty for, I've known Scotty, oh what was that? I've known, I'm meant to do this. Spray It Around Scotty. Yeah of course I know Spray It Around Scotty. I think I've known Spray It Around Scotty for longer than you. No. Yeah I heard. I remember him from when he was on tour with the General throwing, setting him up in the old, that's when I first met you. Remember you took the General out on the road and he was dressed up as a spaceman. A Lex promo wouldn't it? And it went forever and he was bungee jumping every day. I pretty much had to inflate this giant inflatable spaceman slash look after the General. How was that? Cooking breakfast, get him up. Not easy looking after the General. Well cause I was quite new back from overseas at that time and Matt had asked, he's like what is it like with the General on the road? Oh it's really good. And it's like come on mate. What's it really like? A giant inflatable General and a giant inflatable spaceman. Jeez. But you've moved on from spraying it around the mountains and inflating the General to appearing on television and a dating show tonight at 8.30. Yeah I'm really on a low level bottom feed of these days guys. Things haven't been going so well since the Spray It Around Snow report wrapped up so I thought why not go on a dating show to really boost this profile. Look I thought you had a lot. They don't call you Spray It Around Scotty for nothing. You sprayed it around the slopes, you sprayed it around the apres situations. Was that not enough spray for you Scotty? Do you have to go on a dating show as well? When is enough spray Jerry? I just thought that maybe this is an opportunity to find some love. To find that special girl. For people that haven't seen Spray It Around Scotty he's a very good looking man. Very handsome. Dangerously handsome. Very well groomed. Looks great. Smells great. Always smells great. Appears on his Tinder profile holding a dog. I mean that's the kind of man he is. With a turtleneck. It's not his dog. So Scotty you're on First Dates NZ tonight 8.30 on TV TOW. What can you tell us about the process of the First Dates. Because I've been watching First Dates. It's a really good show. It's set at the Sky Tower. Yeah and one of the restaurants in Sky City. It was a bit of an unusual process. I wasn't really looking to go on anything like this. And a friend kind of put me up for it. I think I'd been complaining about my woman situation for some time now. And he just really got sick of me talking about not really going on any dates or anything like that. And filled out the application and got on the show. And yeah it was. I mean if you have seen the show you see that it is quite awkward sometimes. So what's the basic premise? Yeah right. Wow. Two people go on a date. And they arrive. And they've never obviously it's a blind date. They've never met each other. But the interesting thing about the show is there's about five people per show. So five dates going on at the same time. And it cuts between all the dates that are happening. Some are awkward. Some are not awkward. And it's a clever show because obviously they filmed it all the dates are not occurring in one night. But you get the vibe that you're going around a restaurant listening in on conversations that are happening. Any LGBT community dates? Oh yeah. There's always an LGBT factor in each show. You'd have to have an LGBT date in there. Yeah. And they're often the interesting ones because they get smashed. Yeah. They get smashed. What flavour date were you on? You're on the tea were you? I was on the tea from the LGBT and the tea. Yeah I was the tea. Easily. You're in a standard heterosexual situation Scotty. Very much standard heterosexual situation Jerry. And what can you... Did you bring good chat? Yeah. Did she bring good chat? Yeah she did actually. Because I mean on these things you don't really know what you're going to get do you? Did you get hosed? Did you get on the steam? Did you get a head of steamer? Yeah. It's fair to say. She enjoyed her wine. And so I started off on the beers. And she's like no let's move to the reds. So we moved to the reds and... And then did you move back to your house? Or is that going to be a gamble? I guess you can't say that. Well no you can't. I can't. What about those sprite around Scotty? What about if... What about... Could you tell me... Because you know at the end it's always like who's going to pay the bill? Yeah. I'm not convinced that you have to pay that bill because why the hell would you go on a dating show that you had to pay the bill? That doesn't seem right. Well everyone thinks I got paid for it. But I didn't get paid for it. What? And then you had to pay the bill? Or did you go Dutch on it? No no no. Why would you mug yourself off on national television and not pay for a meal? You can't go halves. You can't. You cannot go halves. Matt you would potentially... You've got to go halves on it. Oh god man. You'd have to go halves on it. Well it's sexist not to. And more expensive. Man. It's both sexist and more expensive. That's why the Dutch are such an innovative society with the Dutch writers and the going to the reds. And the reds are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are the ones that are going Dutch. That's why you ended up with butch ass crap. That reasoning right there. Right there. So you paid Scottie? I certainly did Gary I... See Scottie's an old world sort of totally Kerrie Grant kind of handsome kind of operator isn't he. Kerrie Grant. Such a good looking man. So TV 2 tonight Scottie 8.30 firts authority. Have you seen it? No I haven't. I seen it in...? Are you a bit worried? No. with these things like I guess you go on these on these sorts of things expecting that you might get a bit of flak I know my friends have organized a viewing party yeah this evening and I'm probably gonna hear about it for the next six months but I'm prepared for that okay I can't wait to see it first dates NZ 830 TV 2 later a rest made at Christmas in the park because there wasn't very many people there so the cops could see the kids drinking soon Joseph Arthur Parker brushes off fight criticism can I say that again soon Joseph Parker brushes off fight criticism and Kevin Barry brushes his hair completely from the back to the front but now Hugh Hefner responds to internet death rumors Hugh Hefner has insisted he is not dead oh the 90 year old a huge promise quickly spread over the weekend that he had died he hasn't been seen in public since May and last month his ex-girlfriend Kendra Wilkinson at basket admitted she worries about his health every day I've heard that the Playboy Mansion has become dangerously depressing and smells like old man week now yeah smells like old man it is old yeah the Playboy Mansion now and he's getting on a bit at 90 he's have you seen photos of him recently he's looking okay for 90 like 90s pretty old has he had any work done I actually don't reckon he's had a lot of work done none I think that's kind of helped him if he has had work done it's been very subtle it's a sort of a weird thing isn't it because um he was the definition of who everyone arguably wanted to be living the dream of a man but now it just seems a little bit walking around with your sort of nightgown on well that's the great thing is that he's been wearing that he's been wearing the robe the robe what is that? The kimono? Sleeping gown? It's a kimono he's been wearing that kimono for so long now that now that he's dangerously ill and old he's wearing the kimono and it's seamless I mean that's genius genius piece of work from him so he started dressing as an old invalid man like way back in his late 20s and he's just kept going and now it's he's finally growing into being that your own stained old man yeah he loves watching old movies now so he just hangs out he's 90 he watches some old movies not a lot of action going on anymore because he used to boast about his action of course back when he was in his mid 80s yeah that would the do you remember girls of the Playboy Mansion? Yes. That's a reality series what the interesting thing about that was you never ever saw him dancing for a long period of time and the full-length shot? No. Did you ever notice that? You could just see the top of the velvet rope yeah and then him sort of going this weird kind of wobble yeah because even if you ever saw his legs it was it was a humiliating dance maneuver and a lot of his ex lovers because he goes through them and they all look exactly the same Playboy bunny style blonde girls have come out and said he was horrible in the sack not terrible like just an absolute massive disappointment and running a minute operation and just there was nothing going on. I didn't know he was running a minute operation. Strange a lot of bitter tell-all tale books threw that in there to try and sell it in a few extra copies. Hey Jerry up next though I'd like to go through the list of the top five sexiest not dead people. This is the middle of the Matt and Jerry podcast which means... It's not it's not it's not actually it's not the middle. Well close enough to the middle. Yeah but it's not the actual middle. Okay you are a certain ways through the Matt and Jerry podcast there's still some great stuff to come so listen to the end and... The rest of it's not very good either. Okay all right. So waste of time it's a little bit here. Okay well I'll just shut up then shall I? Jesus Christ. In light of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner announcing yesterday that he isn't dead. Yeah. You've handed me a list of your top five not dead people. Yeah. You ready for it? Yeah well I am ready for it. I've got it right here. All right here we go. Number five. Keith Richards. Yeah he's not actually that old but he looks it due to all the smack boos and crack he had over the years. I mean his face is a mess. He looks like he's about 95 but no Keith Richards guitarist from the wrong stones. He's still alive and there's been a lot of T totalers out there that have died before 72 that are just they're just really really pissed off at Keith Richards right now you know. Amazingly he's looked like he's about 86 for about 30 years. He went and about 1984 he suddenly jumped up about 30 years in age and he's just sort of growing on from there. Looks terrible. Okay here on this list. Number four. Sir David Attenborough. Yeah he's 90 the botanist and nature doc voiceover legend bowlegged as hell. I mean if you look at the way if they ever do a wide shot now on him he's his legs are he looks like he's just got off a horse. Yeah he hobbles along like an old puffin. But he's got lots of hair. He's got lots of hair it's sticking up but he's definitely not dead because I bought tickets to his performance here next year. That doesn't mean that he's not dead. Really? No. Well they're not gonna just gonna not gonna like troop. Did you buy them off him? No. Well you think it's a fraud? Yeah maybe. You never know. Number three. It says Angela Lansbury. Yeah. What? Who's that? You remember that TV show Murder She Wrote from the 80s? Yeah oh she was the rust on the roof damp down below. Mmm well I remember that that was the date she was the dangerously old lady who starred in Murder She Wrote in the mid 80s and she's not dead. In fact she's still acting. Really? You would have given you would have given every dollar in your banking out to say that Angela Lansbury would be dead but she's not she's 92. Massive Miss Marples ripoff but still going. Okay number two here. Number two. Gandalf. Yeah Gandalf he's not dead. He he was fighting the the Balrog on the bridge of Moria just after going. You dull-out bards! And then of course the tail nipped up and dragged him in and he said run you fools! And then all the little people cried and cried and cried the hobbits were crying in slow motion with no sound but apparently if you see the second movie which I haven't apparently um he didn't die. Oh massive spoiler alert. In fact he's 2019 years old. That's a massive spoiler. All those people that haven't seen Lord of the Rings are just waiting to watch it at some point. Well I found it a bit ripped off to find out because I got quite upset that he was dead and apparently he just changes his cloak. Hey don't! And then comes back and a fresh cloak and then it's he's all good to go again. You've just ruined it for thousands of people. They're just waiting and hanging out. Alright. Number one. The number one most important not dead person I guess is that what you call this? Mm-hmm. John Key. Yeah he's 55 he's not dead he's just retired and Bill English is the new PM but John Key not dead. Scotty J Stevenson on sport. A monster jab by Blake Griffin. The comeback is complete. America's Cup will stay in America. And sport. There it is. There's the win for New Zealand. Good morning Sky Sports commentator Scotty J Stevenson. Let's get straight into the controversy around the Parker fight Scotty J Stevenson this needs to be addressed massive controversy the thing everyone's talking about and it's Kevin Barry's here. What is happening? Kevin Barry's here. Look let's be honest it's just an extraordinary stylistic expression of Kevin Barry's personality. The entire lid brushed forward from the base of the neck and the whole way it has just been perfectly brushed almost as if to say I know everyone on the planet does it the other way but I'm an individual. The other thing Sky Sports commentator Scotty J Stevenson must be asked is what product is Kevin Barry running in the hair because it always seems to be moist and is that product has that product dripped its way down onto his face because that's the other thing is his face tends to be dangerously moist as well and I've got one final question for you Sky Sports commentator Scotty J Stevenson on the same issue is that product that's coming from his hair dripping down his face is that the reason why he's dangerously red because that's reacting with the Sun's rays and giving him a massive burn on his face? I wouldn't be surprised if there's a little bottling plant in Vegas and it's just bottling Joseph Parker sweat that is then just sprayed liberally into the hair which then drips down the face and we all know Jerry to your last point that usually when you're sweating you're red perhaps Kevin Barry is reacting to the Joseph Parker sweat hair product and this is why we are seeing this visage that we've become accustomed to. Some overseas boxing commentators have suggested that the whole Kevin Barry look is just a massive distraction because Andy Ruiz Jr. he won the first four three to four rounds quite easily but then he was sort of losing his position a little bit and Joseph Parker got back into the fight a little bit and it kind of looked like Ruiz was looking over at Joseph Parker's corner and he was either look it was either Martin Sneddon's fringe or or Kevin Barry's hair kind of right from the very base of his neck forward that was distracting Andy Ruiz. I think there was also a hint that Craig Stanaway was giving him the stink eye at the time and you know no one wants that. Look I wouldn't have been surprised if Ruiz was distracted by Kevin Barry's hair and I mean this is something that other heavyweights in this division are gonna have to come up against as well. You can talk all you like about the jab about ring position but one glimpse of Kevin Barry's hair with the Joe Parker sweat solution in it and I'll tell you what you could be your night over it could be your hopes and dreams crushed. Well that's also I believe he's been running a sunbed the way he has and so he's dangerously red and that way it's essentially like a stoplight that's just flashing in the corner and so when you're boxing if you've got a red flashing light with a bizarre haircut you only need that tiny little bit of distraction you're not thinking about boxing next thing you know you've lost the bout. Well look at Don King I mean for years Don King was operating that straight up in the air shock of hair. It's a distraction. It's a massive distraction. I mean look at birds. Look at what birds do. Don King had the good never to be ringside. He wouldn't be in the corner. He was no corner man Don King. He was a promoter so you know there's arguably no one really had to be distracted by Don King's hair during the fight unlike all of those now coming up against Joseph Parker who have to be distracted by. But you'd see that here walking past the foot we'll just go past you just see like like a troll like a 90s troll doll. Yeah but but I would say this Sky Sports commentator Scotty J Stephenson and Matt as well I'm directing this to you as well the amount of moisture that's coming out of the hair out of the face of Kevin Barry if he's allowed in the ring at any time he can just he can just slip slip he can drop his neck down drop his chin and he can let some of that moisture drip down onto the canvas and that can easily provide and if Joseph Parker moves away from it but directs Andy Ruiz into that he can easily slip. So you're saying that part of the Joe Parker strategy from here on is the other guy on the wet spot. Mm-hmm and then it's almost like having a banana skin underneath your foot. Well people would have noticed the state of the ref in that fight he was soaking wet all over his shirt was completely wet and he was wearing a pair of gloves and there's two theories on that either A he thought they looked cool in a Michael Jackson sort of style or B they were sort of protective gloves like a policeman would wear picking up a drunk person off the road but he was so wet he was so weird and people thought that was coming off the boxer but it was actually just a residual sweat flying off Kevin Barry's face. Thanks a lot Sky Sports commentator Scotty J Stevenson. Matt Heath, Jeremy Wells the Hodaki Breakfast. I'll tell you what Jeremy I'm very excited about Rogue One that's coming out this week the new Star Wars movie being a massive Star Wars fan except for the Phantom Menace, Take of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith those the only Star Wars movies I don't like. Hey um but the best TV series of the of the year has ended now this one yeah Westworld and the thing about Westworld is it was coming out every week rather than the normal binge watching situation hmm so now people that haven't watched it should binge watch it have you watched it? No I haven't actually I just got onto the crown over the weekend I got onto the crown I'm six deep in the crown. Well once you've finished with the crown get onto Westworld. I got Black Mirror lined up next. Oh Black Mirror is bloody good as well but once you finish with the crown and and Black Mirror get onto Westworld. I've got House of Cards lined up after Black Mirror and the crown. Which House of Cards? The last season I'm gonna re-watch that and then also I've got the Sopranos as well I think there's six seasons of that. You haven't watched the Sopranos? No I have I've watched it five times but I'm counting for a sixth round. You'll go all through the Sopranos before you watch Westworld what about if you say that you're gonna watch the wire before you get to Westworld then? I've got to watch the wire actually because I sort of dipped out in the last I kept falling asleep in the last season. I tell you what if you want a show that has more twists and turns than a plate of spaghetti bolognese then you want to watch Westworld. Has it got more meat? It's got it's very meaty. More meat than a bolognese? It's got more meat and sex than a spaghetti bolognese. More cheese than a spaghetti bolognese? There's not much cheese in it actually. Okay. It's pretty cheese-free actually. Well that's probably quite good. Although they do say these violent delights have violent ends. Saying that that's a little that's probably the closest to a cheese. Actually it does have a bit of cheese because some of the storylines for the robots are willfully cheesy within the park. Well I think you need a little bit of parmesan cheese on the top don't you? Just a fraction. Geez I made a bolognese last night for my kids and I put about half a half a block of 1kg tasty on top of their bolognese to cover up some crimes I've committed. With the mince halfway through. What crimes did you commit with the mince? Did you over herb it? I was playing Gears of War 4 online and and and then I burnt the mince till it was pretty much little black charcoal balls. I've watched you you can't do one thing of it you can't just do one thing you get bored so you it's the same as a radio show you pick up something you're on something else you're having a look on your computer doing something else it's like you can't just focus in on one thing. Hey Jeremy we should give away some black cap stickers here thanks to the driving force behind the black cap. You can't even focus in on listening to me talk to you. The judges have made their decisions and now it's time for the Hodaki Breakfast weekly cyber bully award ceremony. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Congeniality. If Bill English is the double dipper from Dipton then Matt Heath is the double douchebag of Dunedin and Jeremy is the punishing power bottom of Pontembe. And please welcome our runner up. I would rather have Starlight McIntosh who feed me a Jim Hickey Cumberger whilst listening to Matt Heath's 2004 Wounder of a Song about doing number one and put up with the back of a length punishment you two wagons put your listeners through most mornings. So from all of us here at Eating Media Lunch. And the winner of Cyber Bully Monday. I tried illegal live streaming Matt and Jerry's show but no one watched it. I tried illegally live streaming Matt and Jeremy's show but no one watched it. And you are this morning's winner of Cyber Bully Monday. Congratulations. Shall we confront our troll? Have you watched Black Mirror yet? I think you've talked about that before. I'm doing the crown first and then I'm going to do Black Mirror. Episode 2 season 3. Great name for a show. Do you think this person's gone to work? I think also as we say before we come up as unavailable for some reason. Blocked number so I think it's the Inland Revenue Department. So do you think this person's done some fraud? I don't know we'll leave a message anyway. At the tone record your message. Hey it's Matt and Jerry from the Hodakki Breakfast here. You're Cyber Bully. I tried illegal live streaming Matt and Jerry's show but no one watched it. You're today's champion. You've won the Cyber Bully prize pack and you're a great New Zealander. Congratulations. Thank you so much for listening to the Matt and Jerry podcast. I know it wasn't easy. And look if you want your money back send a stamped self-advised envelope to POBELT's 1645 Christchurch and they should be able to sort that out in around about 15 working days.\n"
